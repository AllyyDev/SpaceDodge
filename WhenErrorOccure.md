# SpaceDodge
this is the Space Dodge game beach edition 
It is important to mention that if you are going to start simple you have to learn the basics and not just copy the code!!!

(It could be possible that the code doesnt start or that and error occurs, when it happens do the following:)
- go to the terminal and write: pip install pygame
- press enter (if it doesnt go try with pip3 install pygame)
- if that doesnt do it then you either dont have python installed or you didnt put the directory in the path section
- if that is the case here is a link on how to solve it: https://youtu.be/AdUZArA-kZw?si=N89CyTd_3Hmj28yg
- eventhough the tutorial is old, there is still not much difference and dowloading pygame should be fine.
